    "# Finding Web APIs & Storing Data with Python (Rutgers Example)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we’re going to learn a practical workflow for fetching data from web APIs and storing it into a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Observe** what API request a website makes (using Chrome DevTools)\n",
    "2. **Recreate** that same request in Python (with `requests`)\n",
    "3. **Store** the data in a local **SQLite** database\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll use the [Rutgers Schedule of Classes website] (https://sis.rutgers.edu) as a real example, but the process applies to almost any website.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What you’ll end with\n",
    "By the end, you’ll have:\n",
    "- A working Python script (inside this notebook) that fetches real data from an API endpoint\n",
    "- A SQLite database file saved locally in the `data/` folder\n",
    "- A repeatable pattern you can use on other websites\n"
