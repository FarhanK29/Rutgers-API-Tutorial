Now that you've completed the tutorial, it's time to let you apply what you've learned on your own!

# Challenge: Extracting Building Information from Rutgers Maps Website

In this challenge, you'll use the skills you've acquired to extract building information from the [Rutgers Maps website](https://maps.rutgers.edu). The goal is to identify the API requests made by the website to fetch building data, recreate those requests using Python, and store the retrieved data into a local SQLite database.

You should retrieve and store the following information for each building:
- ID
- Name
- Address
- Zip
- Abbreviation

So your database table might look something like this:
| id | building_name | address | zip_code | abbreviation |

This is very similar to what you did in the tutorial, but now you're working with a different dataset and a different API endpoint. Remember to use documentation and resources to help you complete this challenge. The documentation for the libraries you use in the tutorial can be extremely helpful.

Once you've completed the challenge, you'll have the skills to extract and store data from any web API you encounter! Good luck!
